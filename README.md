## ‚ùì What is SketchList 3D?

SketchList 3D is a dedicated design tool for woodworking professionals and hobbyists, offering precision modeling for cabinetry, furniture, and interior layouts. Unlike general-purpose CAD tools, SketchList is tailored for wood-based project planning with realistic boards, joinery, and 3D visualizations.

The software allows users to create detailed cut lists, generate part layouts, and preview real-world builds in photorealistic 3D. With drag-and-drop editing, material libraries, and adjustable dimensions, SketchList streamlines project workflows from sketch to shop.

Whether you're building custom cabinets, planning a home office, or designing shelving units, SketchList 3D provides an intuitive space to visualize, refine, and document every aspect of your woodworking design.
